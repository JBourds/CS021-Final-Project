This paper is about python and is 100% original. I wrote this just as a sample of something which did not access any online resources. In this paper, I will write about a few python things. Python thing number 1: Python's name comes from the creator who really liked Monty Python. Python thing number 2: Python is one of the easiest and most versatile programming languages out there. Python thing number 3: Python is very highly used in machine learning applications using SciKit learn. This is interesting to me because I find machine learning very interesting and want to eventually do something related to it. That's enough about Python, what are some other programming languages people really like? Other popular languages include JavaScript, Java, C, C++, and C#. All of these are high level programming languages but they all do slightly different things.
